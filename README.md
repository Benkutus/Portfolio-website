# Personal portfolio website

[Link to the website (hosted with GitHub Pages)](https://benkutus.github.io/Portfolio-website/)

Basic website made with HTML5, BootStrap and SASS. Currently doesn't include all of my projects as this page was made for web visualization course. *Contact me* part isn't active, as the course required this website to work with only HTML, so we couldn't use PHP.

Will update the website later on and add newer projects/courses/skills.
